_mob and standard versions target the Canvas app and website respectively.

Files are essentially the same except:
- _mob version pre-loads JQuery and JQuery-UI as these are not present in the app
- _mob.css contains JQuery-UI styles for the same reason
- non-_mob version has code to add tiles. AJAX CALLS DON'T SEEM TO WORK IN THE APP!
